It will assist individuals in making informed and efficient decisions on which great neighbourhood to choose from among the many in North York, Toronto. Many individuals are travelling to different parts of Canada, and they need to do a lot of research to find affordable housing and reputable schools for their children. This project is for folks who want to live in a more desirable neighbourhood. For easy access to cafes, schools, supermarkets, medical and food stores, malls, theatres, hospitals, and like-minded people, among other things.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    This project aims to produce a feature analysis for people migrating to North York in order to find the best area by comparing communities. The elements include median house prices and better schools according to ratings, local crime rates, road connectivity, weather conditions, good emergency management, fresh and waste water supplies, excrement carried through sewers, and recreational amenities. It will assist people in being familiar with the area and neighbourhood before to migrating to a new city, state, nation, or location for job or to begin a new life.\n</p>"
